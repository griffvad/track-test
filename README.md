# HTML5 Track Tests

To use this repo, just open it in the WebKit test browser:

    $ /path/to/webkit/Tools/Scripts/run-launcher [--qt] demo.html

## Videos

Most of the files aren't included in the repo because want to keep it
reasonably small. If WebKit is checked out in the same directory as this
repo, the "counting" videos will be taken from `../webkit/LayoutTests/media`.

To get local copies of Sintel and the RUI test media (ClosedCaptions.ts and
UserPrivateStreams.ts), use `./get_files.sh`.
